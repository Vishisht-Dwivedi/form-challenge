# Frontend Mentor - Contact form solution

This is a solution to the [Contact form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/contact-form--G-hYlqKJj). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 



## Overview
This is my solution to the contact form challenge on front-end mentor
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
To take on a little bit of a challenge to myself i built this using html tables and vanilla js and pure css. I used the most of my current knowledge in using the js to instill functionality in the contact form.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flex-box and its manipulation. I also learned a lot about how to handle elements using vanilla javascript and DOM.
